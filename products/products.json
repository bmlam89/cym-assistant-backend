Our formula contains three potent compounds that combat premature aging: Spermidine, and Hyaluronic Acid. Spermidine mimics fasting and caloric restriction to induce autophagy, which limits inflammation and oxidative stress, the main culprits of aging and related diseases. Hyaluronic Acid promotes softer, healthier skin, which helps reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.",

Niacin is also referred to as nicotinic acid and is one of the 13 essential vitamins required by the human body for optimal health. NMN has gained recent attention for its potential for slowing down the aging process and its ability to improve mitochondrial function.Cymbiotika's NMN with added polyphenols and antioxidants can significantly boost NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) levels throughout the body. NAD plays an important role in energy, metabolism and maintenance of healthy gene expression. By boosting NMN levels in the body through NMN supplementation, we enhance the biosynthesis of NAD and help restore declining levels of NAD as we age. Since NAD production is critical for keeping your cells working at optimal levels, Nicotinamide Mononucleotide is seen as an important dietary supplement for maintaining cellular health. ",

Our organic ceremonial matcha is from the first harvest tea leaves, and only the top green tea leaves of each plant are processed in small batches by our national award-winning tea master. A few weeks before harvest, the tea fields are shaded to reduce the production of tannins, preserve the rich chlorophyll content, and increase the l-theanine and caffeine content. Our matcha green tea powder is 100% stone-ground and patiently and diligently crafted, providing you with superior quality and an exceptional experience.",

Magnesium is an essential trace mineral responsible for more than 300 enzymatic systems that regulate diverse biochemical reactions in the body, including muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, blood pressure regulation, and healthy brain development. Prolonged magnesium deficiency can impact your long-term health and since our bodies cannot produce enough magnesium on its own, magnesium supplementation is the most effective way to elevate magnesium levels. Some signs of low magnesium levels include chronic health conditions such as muscle cramps or spasms.Topical, or transdermal magnesium is a quick and easy way to increase magnesium levels beyond taking an oral supplement. You can quickly address sore muscles and tired joints by applying this magnesium spray onto the problematic areas. Our topical magnesium oil spray also prepares your body for bed. Applying before bed can relax your body and mind for a good night's rest.",
